## Searching & sorting
### Binary search
 1. Simple binary search
     - [Smallest letter greater than target](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/)
     - [Peek index in a mountain array](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/)

     - [First and last position of element in sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/)
 2. Tricky Binary search <br/>
    There are multiple conditions we need to figure out if we need to select left or if we need to select right
    - [Find-peak-element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

    - [Missing element in sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-element-in-sorted-array/) (Premium)
 3. Subtle binary search <br/>
    Difficult to recognize if binary search can be applied. The input is not obviously sorted.
